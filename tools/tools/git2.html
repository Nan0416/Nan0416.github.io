            <p class="reference-box">In a detached state, any new commits you make will be orphaned when you change branches back to an established branch. Orphaned commits are up for deletion by Git's garbage 
                collector. The garbage collector runs on a configured interval and permanently destroys orphaned commits.

        <p class="reference-box"> This method of undoing changes has the cleanest effect on history. Doing a reset is great for local changes however
             it adds complications when working with a shared remote repository. If we have a shared remote repository that has the 872fa7e commit pushed 
             to it, and we try to git push a branch where we have reset the history, Git will catch this and throw an error. Git will assume that the branch 
             being pushed is not up to date because of it's missing commits. In these scenarios, git revert should be the preferred undo method.</p>
