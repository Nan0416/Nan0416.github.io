<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Mailgun is a email service that allows setup customized domain.</p>
<div class="featureList">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>How does email works?</h4>
            <p>Email service providers (e.g. gmail, mailgun) setup mail servers, and provide user-agent (mail app clients) to users.</p>
            <p>A user writes/reads emails on user-agent (e.g. Gmail Web interface), which helps the user to send/receive email to/from the his email server (e.g. Gmail server) via POP3, IMAP, or HTTP.<br>
                When the sender's email server (e.g. gmail server) get the user's sending email request, it will send the email to the recipient's email server via SMTP. </p>
            <p>SMTP is used between servers, POP3 and IMAP are used between server and user-agent.</p>
            <p>IMAP provides more operations than POP3.</p>
            <p>With IMAP or POP3 protocol, you can use Apple Mail App to access Gmail Server, use Gmail Web user agent to access 163.com mail server.</p>
            <h4>Practice</h4>
            <p>Suppose you want to use Gmail Web user agent to access 163.com mail server via POP3 or IMAP, then you have to tell Gmail user agent your 163.com username and password because gmail user agent needs them to connect to your 163.com account.</p>
            <p>However, it's not practical and secure to give password to a 3rd party app. In this case, 163.com generates a dedicated app password (e.g. 3 party token) for the gmail user agent to access your account. <span style="color:red">Your "real" password is only used to access the 1st party app.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Outbound email, SPF, DKIM, DMARC</h4>
            <p>In theory, anyone can directly setup a connection with the recipient's mail server, and directly deposit an email to recipient's mail server. At this time, the sender can declare himself with any sender's email address. In other words, the sender can tell the recipient's server that he is ceo@nike.com, and the recipient's server has to figure out some ways to verify the sender's identity.</p>
            <p>SPF: spf is a protocol to setup some TXT record on DNS with contains a list of valid sender IP. For examlple, Nike can setup nike.com with</p>
            <pre class="brush:bash">
                v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all # meaning an email is valid only if it's sent from the mailgun.org server.
            </pre>
            <p>In this case, the recipient server can ask the TXT record from the nike.com and see whether the sender's ip is valid.</p>
            <p>** But this is not enough. Suppose both nike.com and qinnan.dev are using mailgun service, so both of them will add mailgun's ip to their SPF record, which means qinnan.dev is able to send email on behalf of nike.com.</p>
            <p>DKIM is another protocol for protecting the sender's identity. It use public/private key with signature. It stores its public key as a DNS TXT record, so anyone can access it. When the sending an email, the sender's server uses its private key to add a signature on this email. Later on the recipient can acquire the public key from DNS server and validate the signature.</p>
            <pre class="brush:bash">
                k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDDC1z3NIsE4Su2POkHK1d0U9h4VG5zAlROmwatY6KxNaOtqloNe/KQZYg+rEOgiUmSimom2AfO0yTABDIm3z6M0uFFjkxPzIIkpggWbhhHofKIeWToBCP1XjiVPzutYF46MSez1oN8mb8TZVg9ZBRFmn5XeDAkY+dMIbnvNeYRsQIDAQAB
            </pre>
            <p>The key-pair is usually generated by the mail's service provider.</p>
            <p>
                SPF and DKMI provide mechanism for verifying a sender's identity, but some recipient won't utilize these two mechanisms due to some reasoms. DMARC is a policy specified by the sender that define if the recipient should accept this email or not when SPF or DKIM don't pass.
                <br>
                DMARC specifies a TXT record in the _dmarc.domain e.g. v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_report@sousys.com; fo=1<br>
                <span style="color:red">DMARC failed if either SPF or DKIM failed or any of them is not configured.</span>
            </p>    
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Inbound email</h4>
            <p>When sending a email to ceo@qinnan.dev, the sender's server first needs to know the ip address of the recipient's mail server via DNS lookup. In this case, it looks at the <span style="color:red">MX record of qinnan.dev</span></p>
            <p>When an email is delivered to the recipient's server, the recipient server has different options to choose.<br>
                1). gmail: stores into the recipient's inbox<br>
                2). mailgun: configurable, forward to another email, invoke a callback function, store its on mailgun server.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The recipient's username doesn't matter, it depends on how the recipient's server handle it. For a programmable service, such as mailgun, it's just used as a parameter for functions.</p>

        <h3>Gmail in action</h3>
        <div class="featureList">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Sending mail with a customized domain</h4>
                    <p>Gmail allows to send an email with a customized domain. The underlying mechanism is simple, gmail "spoof" your domain.</p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose you have a "example.com" domain and want to send email as "ceo@example.com", you have to first verify you own this email address before you can use gmail to spoof your domain. <br>
                        So gmail will send a verification link to "ceo@example.com" and you verify your ownership by clicking that link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now because gmail is actually spoofing your "example.com" domain, this may also give others a chance to spoof your domain.<br>
                        And gmail doesn't know your DKIM private key so gmail won't sign any signature on your email, which leaves DKIM not passed if you have a DKIM record in your DNS<br>
                        The only thing you can do it's to add gmail.com's SPF record <span class="inline-code">v=spf1 redirect=_spf.google.com</span> as your SPF record. This gives other gmail user a chance to spoof your domain,
                        however, it is kind of safe because gmail has a good reputation and we trust gmail won't allow its users to spoof you.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="color:red">Different vendor behavior.</span><br>
                        1). Using gmail to send a configured customized domain email like above to another gmail account, gmail will issue SPF pass even if the customized domain doesn't add gmail's smtp ip in its SPF record.<br>
                        2). When using gmail to send a @gmail.com email, it has two dkim signature. <span class="inline-code">DKIM-Signature</span>, <span class="inline-code">X-Google-DKIM-Signature</span><br>
                        3). When using gmail to send a @example.com email, it only has one google specified dkim signature. <span class="inline-code">X-Google-DKIM-Signature</span><br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Google Domain forwards inbound domain</h4>
                        <p>Google domain can forward email send to *@yourdomain.com to an another email address.</p>
                        <p>
                            For example, you have a domain "doctier.io", and want to forward any email sent to *@doctier.io to qinnan@yahoo.com.<br>
                            Under the hood, google domain setup MX record for the doctier.io indicates the inbound mail server address is "gmr-smtp-in.l.google.com", and then <span style="color:blue"> gmr-smtp-in.l.google.com will forward this email by "spoofing" it</span>
                            so that "support@qinnan.dev" can find the email is sent directly from the sender instead of forwarding by gmr-smtp-in.l.google.com.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the email is forwarded by spoofing, so it may be denied.<br>
                            <span style="color:red">Example</span>: 163.com sends an email to qinnan@doctier.io. [163.com -> gmail_server -> yahoo.com] <span style="color:red">Received-SPF: fail (domain of 163.com does not designate 209.85.160.170 as permitted sender)</span><br>
                            1). 163.com assemble an email with its DKIM encrytion, and the mail is sent to gmail's server.<br>
                            2). gmail's server receive this email and verify its identity by checking 163.com generate <span class="inline-code">DKIM-signature</span> and 163.com SPF record.<br>
                            3). if pass, gmail's server will add its <span class="inline-code">X-Google-DKIM-Signature</span> and spoof it to qinnan@yahoo.com.<br>
                            4). Yahoo.com treats this email as directly sent from 163.com, and check its SPF however it comes from Gmail server. So SPF failed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It works when the final recipient is a gmail address. [163.com -> gmail_server -> gmail.com]. It still cause SPF failed, but gmail.com always treats a mail that sent from gmail_server (gmail has internal implementation).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also works when [gmail.com -> gmail_server -> gmail.com] becasue <span style="color:red">spf=pass (google.com: domain of ***@gmail.com designates 209.85.220.41 as permitted sender)</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also works when [yahoo.com -> gmail_server -> yahoo.com] because <span style="color:red">Received-SPF: neutral (209.85.166.52 is neither permitted nor denied by domain of yahoo.com)</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>[S -> F -> R]:  R verifies F's ip based on S's SPF.<br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">So in order to receive inbound emails, always let google domain forward them to a gmail account.</span></p>

    <div class="content" id="mailgun">
        <h3>Mailgun in action</h3>
        <p>As using gmail to send email has security issue, where gmail cannot encryt your message with DKIM. So mailgun is a better choose to send email.</p>
        <div class="featureList">
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Current (Nov 9th, 2019) pricing</h4>
                    <p>It's free for the first 10,000 outbound email, and free for unlimit inbound email. But depends on how to handle inbound emails, it still has cost. For example, if you select to forward inbound email to another address, then each forward will be count as a outbound email.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Add a new domain</h4>
                    <p>Create a new domain under the "Sending", add the supply DNS records to DNS service.</p> 
                    <h4>Subdomain</h4>
                    <p>The SPF and DKIM records configured for a subdomain also workds for root domain. In other words, you can setup the SPF and DKIM records for a subdomain, but send emails with the root domain.</p>
                    <p>However, you cannot use the root domain to <span style='color:red'>receive</span> email if you create subdomain with Mailgun. Adding the MX record for root domain also doesn't work. </p>
                    <p>But you can use DNS provider e.g. Google Domain, to forward inbound root-domain email to another email address. Mailgun subdomain MX record and DNS email rootdomain forward can co-exist.</p>
                    <h4>Wildcard subdomin</h4>
                    <p>If you configure a root domain in mailgun, then it can allow you to receive at sub-domain "wildcard domain", but you will need to add MX record in DNS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Sending email with Node.js</h4>
                    <p>mailgun provide nodejs library for sending email, the configuration needs the domain name e.g. "mg.qinnan.dev" and the private api key that can be accessed in mailgun website.</p>
