interface HttpMessageHandler {
    Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage, CancellationToken);
}
abstract DelegatingHandler: HttpMessageHandler{
    HttpMessageHandler: InnerHandler
}

request comes in:
1). someone invoke application_start
2). ask a HttpControllerRouteHandler object
2). someone ask an IHttpHandler (defaultserver) from HttpControllerRouteHanlder object by giving RequestContext, (indirectly ask defaultserver) at this step, it already has routedata.
3). someone send the HttpContext to the defaultserver.
