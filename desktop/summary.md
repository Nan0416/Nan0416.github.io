### <a id="intro">I. Introduction</a>

1. bitmap (raster graphics): a dot matrix data structure used to store and display image. The data structure can be placed inside display's memory to display images.

2. Windowing System (e.g. X window system): the software component used to draw elements and print text on display. A layer on the top of kernel.

3. X Window System ï¼ˆX11) and X.Org: X11 is a windowing system which defines standard, X.Org is one of the implementations. 
* X11 defines a client-server model. Each application is a client to ask the X server draw something. 
* X11 can monitor keyboard, mouse and send events to the corresponding client.

4. Window Manager: create window objects on top of window system. (e.g. ask window system to draw windows). It also control the appearance of windows.

5. Desktop environment: including a window manager but also system menus, starter and taskbar of Microsoft Windows, Dock and Launchpad of MacOS. Each desktop environment would has its own specials. 

6. GUI toolkit/Widget toolkit: a library or a framework that has a few predefined widgets, such as button, text input. Example of GUI toolkit includes GTK, Qt.

```
Desktop Application
GUI toolkit (GTK, QT), Window Manager (Mutter, KWin, Compiz)
Windowing System (X.Org, Quartz on MacOS)
Kernel
Hardware (framebuffer)
```

Input of windowing system is a bitmap, the computation/creation of bitmap is done at top layel. e.g. Window Manager, GUI toolkit, or desktop application.

#### X Server and X window manager
X Server uses a client-server architecture, where a client utilize client library (xlib) to send request to X server.
The request can be "creating a window" request that should be handled by window manager. In this case, the request will be forward to a window manager program from the X server. And then the window manager will than utilize X server to draw windows.
```
x client (xlib, xcb)
  | (ICCCM)
X server <-> X Window Manager
```

In commerical OS, e.g. Windows and MacOS, Window Manager is part of Windowing System, called window compositor.

X Quartz is MacOS X Server implementation on top of Quartz.

### <a id="gpu">II. 3D GPU Application</a>
```
3D GPU Application
GUI toolkit (e.g. GLFW) --- graphics programming interface (OpenGL, DirectX, Metal) ---- Kernel --- GPU. 
[ optional: Windowing System (X.Org)]
Kernel
Hardware (framebuffer)
```

#### OpenGL
OpenGL is a library computes graphics rendering. Each vendor (e.g. Nvidia, AMD) has its own implementation for their hardware. The library is like a RPC between CPU and GPU, which CPU is the client and GPU is the server. The library still runs on CPU, which is to send instruction to GPU, and run the computation on GPU.


### <a id="gui">III. GUI toolkit</a>
GUI toolkit is library/framework layer runs on top of windowing systems. They provides an application with button, textfield, and other widgets.

Examples of GUI toolkits.
1. Cocoa, MacOS, Objective-C and Swift.
2. Qt, Cross-platform, C++.
3. Gtk, Cross-platform, C and bindings to other languages.
4. AWT, JVM, Java.
5. Swing, JVM, Java.
