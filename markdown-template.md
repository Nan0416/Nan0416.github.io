### <a id="intro">Introduction</a>
Markdown is markup language same as HTML. It's designed to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write. It's primary used for creating documentation and not support fancy CSS coloring, layout and animation.

A markdown file can be converted into other format, especially for HTML. Markdown allows to have HTML's __header, images, hyperlinks, list, table, code, font style (bold, italic), quota.__ You can also insert light-weight html anchor, span with css style.

There is no uniform specialization on Markdown. CommonMark is one popular specialization, Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) is a superset of CommonMark with some extensions on Github, such as creating to-do list.

##### limitations
1. Hyperlink doesn't support target="_blank"

*Solution*: some markdown parser support native html, so use native html to replace markdown text.
